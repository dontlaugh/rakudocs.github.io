<p>&quot;Perl&nbsp;5 was my rewrite of Perl. I want Perl 6 to be the community&#39;s rewrite of Perl and of the community.&quot; - Larry Wall (circa 2000)</p>
<p>&quot;I am in favor of this change [a community driven renaming from Perl 6 to Raku], because it reflects an ancient wisdom: &#39;No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.&#39; &quot; - Larry Wall (2019)</p>

<p>The <code>#raku</code> channel was created in October 2019, and will become more active as it becomes the default channel. Eventually, connections to the <code>#perl6</code> will be redirected to <code>#raku</code>, but the historical logs will remain on the <code>#perl6</code> channel. The <a href="https://perl6.org/community/irc"><code>#perl6</code></a> channel on <code>freenode.net</code> has always had a large presence with many developers, who are happy to provide support and answer questions, or just use it as a friendly place to hang out. Check out this <a href="http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/abbreviations.html">IRC lingo</a> resource for the abbreviations frequently used there. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/perl6">StackOverflow</a> is also a great resource for asking questions and helping others with their Raku problems and challenges. More resources can be found in the <a href="https://perl6.org/community/">perl6.org community page</a>.</p>
